function [newUE, newSubPE, newSuperPE, newConst] = reparamEnergy(UE, PE)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%     IN:
%
%     UE - 2xN array of unary terms for N nodes, the first row for bg and the second for fg
%
%     PE - Mx6 array is a list of M arbitrary pairwise potentials.
%     Each row in PE is of the format [i,j,e00,e01,e10,e11] where i and j 
%     are neighbours and the four coefficients define the interaction 
%     potential. 
%     The same pair (i,j) can be repeated several times in PE,
%     but I assume that there are NO SELF-LOOPS. Namely: i~=j
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function reparameterizes the input energy:
% 1. multiple pairwise terms with the same nodes are accumulated, 
% 2. submodular pairwise terms are transformed into a sparse symmetric
% matrix subPE which represents Potts model. This yields additional linear and
% constant terms. Each subPE(i,j)+subPE(j,i) is the the positive cost for
% assigning node i and j different labels.
% 3. supermodular terms are transformed into a sparse matrix superPE. This yields 
% additional linear and constant terms. Each superPE(i,j)+ superPE(j,i) is the positive 
% cost for having both i and j assigned label 2
% 
% The transformation is as follows:
%
% Any pairwise potential in PE is reparameterized
% A row [x y a b c d] in PE corresponds to the following energy terms
% a(1-x)(1-y) + b(1-x)y + c(1-y)x + dxy.
% These terms are rearranged into a constant, unary(for fg) and
% pairwise terms
% a + (c-a)x + (b-a)y + (a-b-c+d)xy.
% In order to reduce the number of edges in a graph, 
% any pairwise potential for a  pair i,j 00 01 10 11, such that j<i,
% is transformed into j,i 00 10 01 11 and combined with other rows j,i
